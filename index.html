          5 July 2021 – DUBROVNIK, Croatia –Today, Rimac Automobili announces
          another major milestone in its history, as it combines forces with the
          iconic automotive brand, Bugatti Automobiles, to create a new
          automotive and technological powerhouse. <br /><br />
          In just 10 years, Rimac Automobili has progressed from one-man garage
          start-up to announcing a new company with one of the world’s most
          iconic car brands to create Bugatti Rimac d.o.o. (in English – LLC).
          <br /><br />
          In an industry evolving at ever-increasing speed, flexibility,
          innovation and sustainability remain at the very core of Rimac’s
          operations. The Croatian-based brand has proven that it can not only
          keep up but be the trailblazer, setting the performance and
          technological benchmark for others. Uniting Rimac’s technical
          expertise and lean operations with Bugatti’s 110-year heritage of
          design and engineering prowess represents a fusion of leading
          automotive minds.

        <h1>The new FERRARI 296 GTB</h1>

        <p>
          The 296 GTB is the first Ferrari road car fitted with a 120°,
          6-cylinder turbo engine. The engine structure means that the
          turbochargers can fit within the “Vee”. This increases its
          compactness, lowers its center of gravity, reduces its mass, and helps
          it achieve extraordinarily high power levels (663 cv). The new Ferrari
          V6 sets a record of 221 hp/l for specific torque output for a
          production car.
